# Community Donated Plugins

The [`spinnaker-plugins`](https://github.com/spinnaker-plugins) GitHub organization is a holding organization for unofficial, community-contributed Spinnaker plugins.
Typical cases for moving a plugin to this organization would include companies who require CLAs for contributions to their main GitHub organizations, but do not want to include that overhead for contributorship to the plugin itself. 
**Donating a plugin to the `spinnaker-plugins` organization is never required.**

Plugin authors looking to transfer ownership of their plugins to the `spinnaker-plugins` organization will:

- Continue to be the maintainers of their plugin.
- Will be granted `maintain` access to the repository. Changes to who has access is handled by the TOC and must be done by creating an issue in the [governance](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance) repo by an existing plugin author.

To start the process of transferring a plugin to `spinnaker-plugins`, [create an issue](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/issues/new/choose) in the governance repository.

Once approved, a member of the Technical Oversight Committee will be in contact for arranging transfer and setup of the repository.
