# SIG Guidance

A collection of guidance for Special Interest Groups.

## Meeting Notes

Notes must be taken during SIG meetings and made available to the public, linked from the SIG's README.md file in the governance repository.

To maintain good cadence, it is generally recommended to have a scribe taking notes who is not the person facilitating the meeting or presenting.

## Meeting Recordings

We encourage SIGs to record their meetings so they are available to people in other timezones. At the same time, we understand that recording meetings may hinder participation in the meetings, so SIGs may choose not to record meetings in general or specific instances. If a SIG chooses to not record a meeting, please inform the SC and TOC so that we have awareness of how often this is happening. It is particularly important that notes are taken and published for any meeting that is not recorded.

At the beginning of the meeting, a disclaimer must be presented to the attendees that the session will be recorded, and that consent is required: Those unwilling to give consent must kindly leave the meeting and are welcome to watch the recording after the meeting has concluded.

Meeting recordings, once available, should be linked from the SIG meeting notes under the section related to that specific meeting. For example:
