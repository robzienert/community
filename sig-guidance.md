# SIG Guidance

A collection of guidance for Special Interest Groups.

## Meeting Notes

Notes must be taken during SIG meetings and made available to the public, linked from the SIG's README.md file in the governance repository.

To maintain good cadence, it is generally recommended to have a scribe taking notes who is not the person facilitating the meeting or presenting.

## Meeting Recordings

All SIG meetings should be recorded. 

At the beginning of the meeting, a disclaimer must be presented to the attendees that the session will be recorded, and that consent is required: Those unwilling to give consent must kindly leave the meeting and are welcome to watch the recording after the meeting has concluded.

Meeting recordings, once available, should be linked from the SIG meeting notes under the section related to that specific meeting. For example:

> # My Cool SIG

> ## 2020.01.01 ([recording link](#))
> 
> - Notes from the meeting
