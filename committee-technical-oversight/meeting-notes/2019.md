# TOC Meeting Notes (2019)

## 5/28/19
- SC has elected to retain control of minting SIGs
- TOC elections
  - Michael Plump and Eric Zimanyi to be nominated for vacant TOC slots (pending SC approval)
- SIGs/TOC sync is this Thursday
  - Want to discuss pushing issue triaging responsibility to the SIGs
  - If the SIGs are receptive, TOC will create a concrete proposal in the community repo for discussion

## 5/14/19
- Ideas to increase usefulness of github issues
  - SIGs take responsible for their slice of the issue
  - Standard label and process for issue management

## 4/30/19
- Suggestion that we consider reorganizing code such that it more clearly fits the model of “core” vs “integration”
  - Recognition that majority of contributions being made to Spinnaker involve an integration with an additional cloud provider or some other 3rd party system.
  - A large portion of these contributions are made to artifacts that also contain core Spinnaker implementations. 
  - Support for CODEOWNERS files.
  - Support for building packages that exclude integrations and their respective dependencies.
  - See examples in orca-integrations-gremlin or orca-integrations-cloudfoundry.
