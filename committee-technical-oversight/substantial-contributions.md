# Substantial Contributions

This page lists contributions which the Technical Oversight Committee _does not_ consider significant contributions, but it is not limited to those defined here:

* Version dependency bumps.
  * Exception: If a version dependency change requires broad or nuanced changes to the codebase alongside.
* Non-functional changes (e.g. formatting, style).
