# SIG Creation

Manual steps involved in creating a SIG.

- Setup Mailing Lists
  - `sig-{name}@spinnaker.io`
  - `sig-{name}-leads@spinnaker.io` (the members of this DL should also be added to the main list)
- Setup Github
  - `sig-{name}` team. Leads should be set as Maintainers of the Team
  - `sig/{name}` label in `spinnaker/spinnaker`
  - Add team to relevant `CODEOWNERS` rules for any applicable repos
